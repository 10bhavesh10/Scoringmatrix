Genetic Algorithm:

A whitebox neural network is created and the network is trained and the weights are optimized using the genetic algorithm.

Cultural Algorithm:

A blackbox neural network is created and the network is trained and the weights are optimized using the cultural algorithm.

Note:

I didn't have an idea on how to proceed on implementing particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization on neural network. I will learn it and implement the algorithms in the neural network.
