Genetic Algorithm:

A whitebox neural network is created and the network is trained and the weights are optimized using the genetic algorithm.

Cultural Algorithm:

A whitebox neural network is created and the network is trained and the weights are optimized using the cultural algorithm.

In the given dataset, genetic algorithm optimizes better than the cultural algorithm and the accuracy is higher in the neural network 

Note:

I didn't have an idea on how to proceed on implementing particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization on neural network. 
I will learn it and implement the algorithms in the neural network and submit it in the repository.
